    <h1>Chicken Fried Rice</h1>
    <h3>If I had to choose a dish I have to eat for the rest of my life, it would be fried rice.</h3>
    <p>In order to make this dish for 2 people, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of cooked, chilled rice. Day-old cold rice is perfect.</li>
        <li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>2 diced chicken thighs. You can fry some wings and drumsticks to eat with, but this doesn't included in this tutorial.</li>
        <li>2 gloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed eggies: carrots, onions, peas, corn, bell peper, ... depends on your appetite</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional), and vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Seasoning to taste: salt, peper,...  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps to make chicken fried rice: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, rice wine and cornstarch for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry chicken in preheated pan with vegetable oil until cooked and set it aside. </li>
        <li>In the same wok or pan, add the remaining vegetable oil, and stir-fry veggies for 2-3 minutes on high heat until they soften.</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and pour the beaten eggs into the other side. Scramble the eggs until they are  cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the cold rice to the skillet with the cooked vegetables and eggs. Stir-fry everything together, breaking up any clumps of rice.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken back into the pan and continue to stir-fry for a few more minutes until everything is heated through.</li>
        <li>Final step, pour the soy sauce over the fried rice and stir evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, drizzle a small amount of sesame oil over the rice for extra flavor. Garnish with chopped green onions if you like.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some tips for a successful fried rice: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using cold rice is the best for making fried rice because it's less sticky.</li>
        <li>Have all your ingredients chopped and ready before you start cooking. Fried rice cooks quickly, so you won't have much time to chop things as you go.</li>
        <li>High heat is important to make good fried rice. A good fried rice is the right balance between crispness and softness of ingredient. If rice is fried under low heat, it will be dried.</li>
        <li>Keep stiring constantly. This helps distribute heat evenly and prevents sticking or burning.</li>
        <li>Taste the rice as you cook to ensure it meets your flavor preference.</li>
        <li>It's better to serve with some fried wings and chilli sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I like chicken fried rice because of its delicious and versatile flavor. It offers a mix of textures, is easy to prepare, and provides a comforting, balanced meal. It can be made with leftover ingredients or fresh ones, chicken fried rice is a go-to dish for enjoying a quick, flavorful meal.</p>
